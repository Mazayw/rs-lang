_**RS Lang** - service for learning English words._

[Deploy](https://mazayw.github.io/rs-lang/ "RsLang")

## Usage

#### Textbook
The collection contains 3,600 frequently used English words. The words in the collection are sorted from the simpler and more familiar to the more complex ones. The first 400 most frequently used words are not included in the collection. These are considered to be the basic adult vocabulary left over from previous attempts at language learning. The entire collection is divided into six sections, each section has 30 pages, and each page has 20 words to learn.

#### Dictionary
The dictionary consists of two sections: difficult words and learned words. You can make a list of difficult words, and when you learn a word, add it to the learned section.

#### Mini-games
There are two mini-games in the app: Sprint and Audiocall.
In the Sprint game, you need to guess the translation for as many English words as possible within a certain period of time.
In the Audiocall you need to listen to the word and choose the correct translation. 
At the end of the games the results will be shown.

#### Statistics
The stats page contains the daily results of your games: sprints and audiocall, as well as the overall statistics for the day.
